JOC Cockpit
===========================

Copyright (C) 2005-2016 SOS GmbH, Berlin.

Extract the archive joc_linux.1.11.2.tar.gz to an arbitrary directory,
e.g. /tmp/ and run the installer dialog for the JOC using

/tmp/joc.1.11.2/setup.sh


The setup.sh calls sudo to get root permissions.
It is strongly recommended that you not logged in as root.


root permissions are not mandatory.
If you want to start the installer without root permissions
then you can call it with the -u option.

/tmp/joc.1.11.2/setup.sh -u


If you want to start the installer without dialog, e.g. no X-Server is installed,
you have to extract the file joc_install.xml too, e.g. to /tmp/.
After you have configured the joc_install.xml you call

/tmp/joc.1.11.2/setup.sh /tmp/joc.1.11.2/joc_install.xml

or

/tmp/joc.1.11.2/setup.sh -u /tmp/joc.1.11.2/joc_install.xml


A shell in /bin/sh is required.

JOC requires an Oracle Java environment at least 1.8.x.
